That means it can be used for just about anything.\nOne can use it to build website, web apps and desktop apps. But it\u0026rsquo;s also used in scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and data analysis!\nWhy learn Python? Python is seen as the number one language to learn. Here are a few reasons why:\n It\u0026rsquo;s simple to read and understand  This makes it an ideal language for beginners to learn. And it acts as a stepping-stone for learning other object-oriented languages.\nPython is also concise.\nFor the same task, Python requires 3-5 times less code than Java, and up to 10 times less code than C++.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a powerful language for data science  Python is the preferred language for Data Science and Machine Learning. Both areas with exciting work and a growing demand for jobs.\nA huge community of web developers use it  It\u0026rsquo;s popularity for web development means that there are numerous open source libraries, frameworks and source of help for beginners.\nOne can use Python to build whatever one want to build, from a scraper to an e-commerce site.\nPython Versions Python3 is the latest and best version to learn.\nPython3 is easier for beginners to understand, and is being updated frequently so there are fewer bugs.\nIn the latest version of Python, text is printed as follows:\n1  print(\u0026#39;Python 3\u0026#39;)   Older version\n1  print \u0026#39;Python 2\u0026#39;   Python treats print as a function rather than a statement, so one must pass items that one want printed in parentheses.\nSome programmers still use versions of Python 2, with 2.7 being the last major release.\n Since the start of 2020 Python HQ are no longer working on improvments to Python 2 and have advised everyone to switch over to Python 3.\n Python Environment Python comes pre-installed on most operating systems. It can also be downloaded online for free.\nOnce installed, one can type python3, python or pyto run the Python interpreter from the shell:\n1 2 3 4 5  # python 3.7.6 # (default, Dec 30 2019, 11:42:19) # Type \u0026#34;help\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;copyright\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;credits\u0026#34; or # \u0026#34;license\u0026#34; for more information. \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;   This gives one a local interactive environment where one can run Python code and output the results.\n The Python interpreter is one playground. So test things!\n It is the ideal place for testing out small pieces of code or calculations.\nFor example:\n1 2 3  \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; 4 * 5 # 20 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;    For anything longer than a few lines of code, it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to use a text editor.\n Some of the most popular text editors are Notepad, Atom, VIM, Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code.\nRecommended is Visual Studio Code for beginners.\nOnce one is using a text editor one can save files using a .py extension and then open them from the shell by running:\n1  python3 myPyFile.py   Hello World! Write the first Python program, and print Hello World! to the screen!\nTo do this, in the Python interpreter, one can use Python\u0026rsquo;s print function as follows:\n1  print(\u0026#39;Hello World!\u0026#39;)   The output is\n1  # Hello World!   In this program, one use the Python\u0026rsquo;s built-in print function.\nSyntax \u0026amp; Numerical Operators Control Flow I Control Flow II Sequential Data Types I Sequential Data Types II Unordered Data Types Looping Functions Tips Intro to Modules Basic File Manipulation Playing with Time Working with Strings Classes I Classes II Utilities I Is Your Python Healthy?

Git is standard of version control.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the most commercial (and open-source) projects ust to keep track versions of their products.\n It was developed by Linux Torvalds\n Why Git? Before Git things you had to\n Get all previous changes from the central server. Edit the files and make sure they work. Send all the changes to the central server.  Now with Git, every developer can have their own copy of the project.\nYou call this know Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)\nIf you have a Software with version v2.5 with the next release being v3.0.\nThe users have reported a but in version v2.5, but the release is only couple week away.\nGit lets copy v2.5, fix the bug and release v2.5.1. Everything without touching v.3.0. This is due to how branching works.\nBenefits of Git The Benefits of Git are\n Everything can be done locally. Each clone has a full history of changes. Recreate the main version from local version. Revert the change to fix an unforseen bug. Flexible. Not only for developers.  Installing Git To be able to use Git, you must make it available on your machine.\nYou can install Git in various ways, depending on your Operating System.\nMac OS X You can install Git by running git from the terminal, which will prompt you to proceed with the installation.\nLinux Depending on your Linux distribution and package management tool you cann install Git:\n using dnfon Fedora/Red Hat:  sudo dnf install git using apt on Debian:\nsudo apt install git Windows There are multiple ways of installing Git on Windows.\nThe easiest way is to install GitHub Desktop, which comes with a command line version of Git as well as the GUI.\nAnother option is to install Git for Windows, which brings the full feature set of the Git SCM to Windows.\nGetting Started Basic Git configuration After installation you can customize different variables or information in your Git environment.\nFor example you can change your username and email address so that your work shows your identity.\nGit provides the git configtool, making it easier to change configuration variables that affect how Git works and looks.\nList all current settings:\ngit config --list user.name=John Doe user.email=johndoe@example.com color.status=auto color.branch=auto To see a specific setting:\ngit config user.name John Doe To change your identity:\ngit conifg --global user.name \u0026quot;My Name\u0026quot; git config --global user.email myname@email.com Git will sometimes ask for user input by invoking the systems default text editor. To change what editor is used by Git:\ngit config --global core.editor vim Initializing a Git repository There are two primary ways to include a project under Git control:\n Bring an existing project/directory on your machine under control of Git Import a Git repository from another server by cloning it from within a project\u0026rsquo;s directory:  cd myGreatProject Now you can simply:\ngit init This will create a (hidden) .git subdirectory, enabling Git to manage your source files.\nCloning a Git repository A second way through which you can get your hand on a Git repository is by cloning it.\nThe term cloning entails how the whole Git flow works. Instead of providing a working copy, the git clone command makes a full copy of the repository, including all projects history.\nIf in one case a server failure, corruption or other unfortunate events, any clone can be used to restore the state of the project.\nThe syntax used to clone a repository is:\ngit clone [URL] You can clone any open-source project or even privte ones as long as you have the right credentials.\nFor example, you can clone the reduck library from the specific URL:\ngit clone https://github.com/reduck/reduck Running this command will:\n create a directory named \u0026ldquo;reduck\u0026rdquo; initialize a .git directory inside pull all repository data in the .git directory checkout a working copy of the latest version of the project  Another name for the parent directory can be specified as follows:\ngit clone https://github.com/reduck/repo \\myGreatClone Apart from the https protocol used above, git also suupports transfer through SSH and local protocols.\nSome common terminolgy The most important is to understand the standard terminology in Git in order to adequately grasp how it works.\nThis terminology includes the following terms:\nBranch A branch is a movable pointer. It points always to the most recent commit. Branches are used for different team members to work concurrently without affecting the main repository.\nRevision A revision is different version of the repository.\nCommit As you save your work in a repository you commit the changes (the contents of the working tree). This create a unique commit object that uniquely identifies a new revision of the content in that repository.\nHEAD The HEAD is a reference to the last commit in the branch currently in use.\nTag A tag is a pointer to a specific commit which uniquely identifies a repository version. With Tags are used to easily revert to old versions when in need.\nStaging area The staging area is where work expected to be committed is staged.\nIndex The staging area is also referred to as index.\nCommits What is stored in a commit? When you make a commit, git stores a commit object.\nYou can view the commit information stored in theh commit objects for that repository by using git log.\ngit log commit ac02a5 Author: John Doe \u0026lt;john@doew.com\u0026gt; Date: Thu Feb 30 10:59:21 2021 +0000 changed content of README Each commit object contains a checksum, the author\u0026rsquo;s name and email, the commit message, and a pointer to the commit that came before it (or multiple commits)).\nHow to write a git commit message Each commit message should explain the aim of the commit and why the changes were made.\nFor simple commits, this is an example of best practice:\ngit commit -m \u0026quot;Fix typo in README\u0026quot; For a longer commit, one should leave a line after the subject and include more description in the body of the commit:\ngit commit # commit message editor Redirect user to the login form Issue 4832 Your commit with some useful description of your problem One should stick to a convention that is consistent with the rest of your team.\nCustom commit template One can add a commit message template to git, to help write clear mesages.\nFirst, you can create template file template.txt\nsubject line (max 50 chars) issue no: X commit body (max 72 chars) Then you can set this template to be the default commit editor message using commit.template:\ngit config --global commit.template ~/.template.txt When you run git commit the template will apear in the editor.\nCherry-pick a commit Cherry- picking is a method to apply a single, specific commit from another branch.\nExample:\ngit checkout master git cherry-pick a5829bd5 # merge commit a5829bd5 (from another branch) # with branch master This is most useful when one is unable to merge two branches. For example, one want to fix security issue present in both branches.\nWhat is a checksum? A checksum is a SHA-1 hash, which is a 40-character string of hexadecimal characters.\nExample:\n85d5ff4802678921id5922a24f6836bc0a1c59263 Git refers to everything stored in the database by a checksum that it calculates based on the contents of the file or directory structure.\nWhen one commit some changes, git produces a checksum referring to that commit.\nBy using checksums git can detect if you\u0026rsquo;ve lost information or if a file is corrupt.\nIn most places you can us a shorter version which is a 7-character hex string 58c1ff5\nFundamentals What is Version Control? Version Control defines a system intended to help record and manage changes in source code.\nUsing a Version Control System, or VCS, different versions of a file collection or project can be created or changed, each version is representing the exact state of the project at a given time.\nKeeping this in mind, one can revert, compare and even switch between the versions of a prject\u0026rsquo;s files.\nOther benefits include:\n complete history of file changes, which simplifies tracking and fixing bugs backup is always immediately available team members are able to work concurrently, thus minimizing the risk of conflicts between their work  There are three main distinguishable types of VCS software:\n Local Version Control - the simplest VCS, which works by keeping local copies of the files versions on your computer. Centralised Version Control (CVCS) - developed to make collaboration within a team easier. Instead of a local database, a single centralized sever is used to keep all file versions from which team memebers can check out them. Distributed Version Control (DVCS) - rather than only the latest changes to file, each team member has a full copy of the project including history.  What is Git? Git is the name of the most widely used Distributes Version Control System and is the standard of version control for both commercial and open source projects.\nFundamental to the Git nature, being a DVCS, is the fact that people working on prject will always have a local copy of the project will always have a local copy of the project, the repository, containing the full history of changes. This remote backup of the codebase entails a good layer of protection against data loss.\nOne other characteristic of Git that helps it differentiate from other version control system is security. The content of files, the relationship between then among other Git-specific objects are secured by cryptographic hashing with the SHA1algorithm.\nDifferen from some VCSs, Git versioning (the way it keeps track of different versions of a file) is not based on the names of the files, but on the content of the file itself.\nAs a result of high raw performance from its specialized algorithms, as well as being smart and flexible, Git has become the de facto standard of version control.\nHow does Git work? Being able to use Git effectively requires understanding how it works on a fundamental level.\nFirst, the main difference between Git and other VCSs is the way it handles data. Most systems think of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time.\nInstead, Git thinks of data like a set of snapshots. Conceptually, every time a change is made in the prject, a picture is taken of how every file looks at that moment and a reference to that is stored as a snapshot. The act of saving the snapshot is called commiting. The snapshot stored in the repository is called a commit.\nAdditionally, to grasp the workflow of Git, you must be able to differentiate possible states of a file and to know how to work with them. There are two types of files inside a Git repository:\n untracked: Git doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about the file\u0026rsquo;s existence and can\u0026rsquo;t be included in a commit. tracked: Git will take this file into account when calculating what to be committed.  Another critical aspect of Git is that almost all of its operations are local, with all information such as history being an integral part of the repository. This boosts the speed of many operations and makes working with Git easier than with some other VCSs - since a connection to the Internet is not always necessary.\nThe Git working tree During the development process, a project can grow to thousands of files.\nThose files you are currently working on - and changes that may or may not be committed as part of a Git repository - constitute the working tree. Some of these files may be part of a previous commit, but in a different form.\nThe working tree represents files that have been created, updated or modified and diverge from the contents of the most recent commit.\nTracked files in the working tree are represented in Git based on different statuses:\n modified or dirty: the file is changed, but Git has yet to calculate the differences and label the versions. staged: the differences are calculated, and the new structure of the project can be saved. committed: the new version is safely stored in the repository.  A user can add the changes to a repository at any point through commits, but also revert those changes.\nBranches in Git Branching allows developers to diverge from the main line of development without affecting other work.\nBranching in Git differs dramatically from other VCS and is consideredd its \u0026ldquo;killer feature\u0026rdquo;. Branches in Git are considered lightweight and simple. For that reason branching, which is feared in other VCS is highly encouraged in Git.\nUnderstanding and mastering this is paramount to proficiecy and expertiese with Git.\nConceptually, a branch is divergence at a specific point from your working tree.\nChanges (technically commits) are added to the history of the current branch, resulting in a fork in the project history. In practice, a branch is merely a pointer to a specific commit object.\nWith the git branchcommandn you can create, edit, rename and remove branches.\nBranches are often used as a reference when working with git merge and git checkout.\nTo list all your brnaches:\ngit branch * develop new feature master Create a new branch:\ngit branch my-branch # will not switch to it Delete a branch:\ngit branch -d my-branch # unmerged changes will stop this git branch -D my-branch # will force delete To rename the current branch:\ngit branch -m new-branch-name Thinking of a branch as a pointer to a specific state of the repository, you can visualize how changing to a different branch takes you to a different stage of the same project. Different changes of the same project are stored on different branches. To change the branch you are on, you can use git chekcout\ngit checkout my-branch Local Repository The Local Repository The local Git project is made of three main areas:\n working tree staging area (also know as Index) the .gitdirectory (the repository)  Working tree\nThe working tree is the place where all files exist. This is always a single chekcout of one project\u0026rsquo;s versions.\nStaging area\nUnlike most VCSs, Git has an additional step between the working copy (directory) and the data store (repository). This place is the staging area and letzs you decide what changes are included in a commit.\nRepository\nThe repository is the proprietary datastore where Git maintains the history of the project (all commit objects, tags, and a lot more).\nWorking in the local repository Changing the content of the files in your Git project won\u0026rsquo;t directly affect your local repository. To do this, you must perform some operations to make sure your changes are permanently stored.\nFrom the perspective of Git, files can be:\n tracked - these files were part of the most recent file snapshopt and will be flagged as modified, unmodified or staged. untracked - were not part of the last snapshot, nor are in the staging area.  When Git detects a file is edited and it\u0026rsquo;s different from the previous commit, it will be flagged as modified.\nThe next step is to get the file in the staging area. You can add a snapshot of a file there with the git add command.\nLast, and most important, you permanently store the staged files to the Git repository only when the git commit command is executed.\nTracking and Stagingn files You can easily check the status of your files inside a Git project with the git status command:\ngit status # On branch master # Your branch is up-to-date with # 'origin-master' # nothing to commit, working directory # clean The message in the code snippet above is shown when there are no tracked and modified files.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s suppose you add mytext.txt to your project. Running the same command you will see a different result:\ngit status # On branch develop # You branch ... # Untracked files: # enki.txt # noting add to commit ... One can see that the mytext.txt file is untracked. In order for Git to manage changes in this file (track it) one must use the git add command:\ngit add mytext.txt In case one need to add more than a single file, naming them one by one isn\u0026rsquo;t going to work out. Here are the options for adding multiple files:\n# stages everything git add [-A|--all] git add . # stages everything but new files git add [-u|--update] Running git statusagian, you cann see that the file is now staged and ready to be part of a commit:\ngit status # ... # Changes to be committed: # new file: mytext.txt Committing Committing is the action which permanently stores changes in a file as part of the Git repository. For this operation, one have to do is issue the git commitcommand.\nNormally, Git will never change the contents of a commit, making commits permanent and representative for the state of the project at that time.\nOne can commit the staged snapshot by running:\ngit commit One will be prompeted with the default text editor asking for a commit message. After filling the commit message and saving the file, the actual commit is created.\nTo commit and avoid the text editor one can include a commit message as part of the command like this (-mfor message):\ngit commit -m \u0026quot;My first commit\u0026quot; One can also use the -aflag to commit all changes of tracked files (even though they were modified, but not staged with git add):\ngit commit -a Stashing Another usefule fueature of Git allows one to set aside current work; usually to switch branches without losing uncommitted changes.\nStashing is the action of saving all ones dirty files (modified tracked files and staged changes) in a special stack of commits. Any of the commits in the stash can be later popped, restoring the state of the working tree.\nThe key to this feature is the Git command git stash.\nIf one have some modified files, ine can check on them with git status:\ngit status # ... # Changes to beb committed: # modified: mytext.txt To stash your changes:\ngit stash # Saved working directory and index state # HEAD is not u0374 ... Checking again, the working directory is clean:\ngit status # On branch master # Your branch is up-to-date with # 'origin/master' ... One can see all your stashed changes:\ngit stash list # stash@{0}: WIP on master: 823k824 ... # stash@{1}: WIP on master: 58d28a1 ... To apply the lastest stashed changes:\ngit stash apply To apply a specific stashed set of changes, one must specify its name:\ngit stash apply stash@{2} One can also remove from the stash stack:\ngit stash drop stash@{0} To both apply and drop the stash, the popcommand can be used:\ngit stash pop The Remote Repository Introduction to remote repositories Remote repositories in Git representn a copy of the repository that exists elsewhere (remotely)\nOne can have multiple remote repositories, with different permissions on each one. Some can be read-only while on some you can perform both read and write operations.\nThese remote repositories are useful and, most of the time, represent a requierement when collaborating as part of a team.\nEven though about 90%of version control related work happens on local repositories, the remote ones are needed to share the date between different team members.\nIt is important for a team memeber to know how to manage (add, remove, etc.) and work with data (push and pull changes) from remote repositories to be able to collaborate effectively.\nRemote repositories can be a GitHub repository, a user\u0026rsquo;s fork on a server or just another computer on your local network.\nPushing and Pulling to/from remote repositories can be accomplished with HTTP and SSH protocols.\nGitHub, for example:\n SSL like  https://github.com/user/repo.git\n SSH like  git@github.com:user/repo.git\nWorking with remotes Remote repositories are fundamental to the workflow for theams who need to collaborate.\nOne can see the remote repositories with your project by calling git remote:\ngit remote # origin  Keep in mind that origin is the default name git gives to the server one cloned from.\n Using the -vflag, one can also see the URLs associated with the remotes:\ngit remote -v # origin https://github.com/user/rep (fetch) # origin https://github.com/user/rep (push) One can add new remotes with the git remote add command:\n# git remote add \u0026lt;shortname\u0026gt; \u0026lt;url\u0026gt; git remote add xy https://github.com/us/repo git remote -v # origin https://github.com/user/rep (fetch) # origin https://github.com/user/rep (push) # xy https://github.com/us/repo (fetch) # xy https://github.com/us/repo (push) Tracking and Staging files One can easily check the status of your file inside a Git project with git status command:\ngit status # On branch master # Your branch is up-to-date with # 'origin-master' # nothing to commit, working directory # clean The message in the code snippet above is shown when there are no tracked and modified files.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s suppose one add mytext.txt to your project. Running the same command one will see a different result:\ngit status # In branch develop # Your branch ... # Untracked files: # mytext.txt # nothing added to commit ... One can see that the mytext.txtfile is untracked. In order for Git to manage changes in this file (track it) one must use the git addcommand:\ngit add mytext.txt In case one need to add more than a single file, naming them one by one isn\u0026rsquo;t going to work out. Here is some options for adding multiple files:\n# stages everything git add [-A|--all] git add . # stages everything but new files git add [-u|--update] Running git status again, one can see that the file is now staged and ready to be part of a commit:\ngit status # ... # Changes to be committed: # new file: mytext.txt Merging Merging is the operation of joining two or more development histories (branches) together.\nFor this, Git provides the git merge command:\ngit merge [head] The merging operation will automatically integrate two different branches into a single one.\nEven though the algorithms used for the merge depend on the status of the branches, all of them will merge into the current branch. It is important to understand that the targeted branch is not affected.\nSuppose you are on a branch called featurewhere you committed some work. However, one want to get the feature to the master branch; the main branch of development on your project.\n# Current branch - feature git checkout master # Current branch - master git merge feature # Merging feature INTO master However, merging is not always successful because conflicts can arise when both branches had modifications in the same file(s) (changes since the time they diverged). In this case Git doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what version of the file to choose and requires your guidance.\nOne can check what files weren\u0026rsquo;t successfully merged using the git status command:\ngit status # On branch master # You have unmerged paths. # ... # Unmerged paths: # ... # both modified: file.txt # ... When a merge conflict occurs the git status command even provides one directions on how to proceed.\ngit status # On branch master # You have unmerged paths. # (fix conflicts and run \u0026quot;git commit\u0026quot;) ... In these files one can see the conflict highlighted by the syntax:\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; HEAD # master in our case # master version here ======= # feature version here \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; feature Above the ======line one can see the version of the file that was in the HEAD before the merge, while under one can see targeted branch version.\nOne must manually resolve these conflicts (save the file as one wish it to be) and commit the update(s). One may then push the changes.\nPushing Pushing is the way to share/push upstream your work on a remote repository.\nThe basic syntax of the git push command is:\ngit push [remote-name] [branch-name] If you want to push all your local commits to the origin server on the master branch (both automatically named) you can use:\ngit push origin master One can also run git push without arguments to push to the upstream of your current local branch.\nIf, for example, you are on feature branch and you want to set it\u0026rsquo;s upstream you need to use the --set-upstream flat:\ngit push --set-upstream origin feature This will create if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t already exist, a new remote branch called feature, and push all your changes there.\n Keep in mind that the git push command only works if one have write permission to the remote repository.\n If the history differs from your local - due to somebody pushing changes since your last pull or fetch - your push will be rejected. To fix this, you must first fetch, merge (or just pull) their work. Your push will be accepted once all merging conflicts are resolved.\nBranching Fetching a remote branch If one are working on a local version of a remote branch and someone else updates the remote branch, one might want to synchronize your version.\nTo do this, one run git fetch \u0026lt;remote\u0026gt;, which updates your local repository with any changes to the remote.\nExample to synchronize with origin remote:\ngit fetch origin To fetch all the remotes:\ngit fetch --all  Changes are not automatically applied to the local branch, one have to do this yourself with git merge.\n Managing branches If one want to see a list of your branches, one can run git branch:\ngit branch experimental * master noDistractions The * indicates the branch that is checked out.\nOne can use -vto see the last commit on each branch.\nOne can use --merged or --no-merged to list the branches one have or haven\u0026rsquo;t merged to the current branch:\ngit branch --merged * master noDistractions git branch --no-merged experimental Pulling a remote branch git pull is a command that combines git fetch and git merge\nFor example, to fetch and merge the branch master with the current branch:\ngit pull origin The merge is automatic, and you are unable to review the commits. For this reason, sometimes you can use git fetch and git merge instead.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also the -a (shorthand for --append) flag targeting the fetch part of pulling. It tells git to append new branch HEADs to the .git/FETCH_HEAD file instead of overwriting everything with what\u0026rsquo;s remote.\nPushing to a remote branch If you want to share a branch, you have to push it to the remote.\nTo do this, you run git push \u0026lt;remote\u0026gt; \u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\nFor example, to push a fix:\ngit push origin scrollFix If one want to push a local branch into a remote branch but call it by a different name, one can use this format:\ngit push origin scrollFix:uiFix Setting the upstream branch When one use the git clone or git checkout commands on a remote repository, a tracking branch is set up automatically.\nInstead, you can explicity set the upstream branch by usiing the -u or --set-upstream-to options.\nFor example, to set the current branch to track the remote branch scrollFix:\ngit branch -u origin/scrollFix What is rebasing? The git rebase command is a way to combine branches. In a basic rebase, you \u0026lsquo;replay\u0026rsquo; the changes made on one branch onto the other.\nFor example, to rebase the changes committed to scrollFixonto master:\ngit checkout scrollFix git rebase master This works by \u0026lsquo;rewinding\u0026rsquo; scrollFixto the commit shared by the two branches and saving the changes in a temorary file. The scrollFix reference is then set to the same as master and the changes are applied.\nYou can then get masterto point at the final commit:\ngit checkout master git merge scrollFix Now if you look at the history, it will seem like all the changes happend in series, when they were made in parallel.\nGit - Workflow Workflow Workflow: long running branches Long-running branches are branches that one create to work on for the long-term.\nFor example, the branch mastercould be for stable code and developfor testing.\nYou could create a fix to a new issue on the topic branch issue03. You could merge this with develop and test its stability:\ngit checkout develop git merge issue03 # merge into develop # test the stability If the fix proves to be stable, one could then merge with master.\nThis can be helpful for large, complex projects.\nWorkflow: topic branches A topic branch is a branch that you create and use for work on a feature.\nThe idea is to work on a fix or an experiment separately from the master branch. This makes it easier to review changes, as all the commits related to one topic.\nFor example, you could work on solving an issue:\ngit checkout -b issue03 # checkout as a new branch \u0026quot;issue03\u0026quot; # fix the issue Once one have solved the problem one can merge it into the master branch:\ngit checkout master git merge issue # merge the fix Then one can delete the topic branch:\ngit branch -d issue03 Squashing commits If one contribute to an open source project, e.g, by submitting a pull request with a bug fix, it should be presented as one unit of code.\nOne should squash your commits together. For example, if one have three commits:\ngit reset HEAD~3 git add . git commit -am \u0026quot;Fix bug #14\u0026quot; git push --force The --force option is needed if the commits have already been pushed, for them to be replaced. Beware that this overwrites the prevous history so always avoid when possible.\nBy sqaushing one can get rid of \u0026quot;fix typo\u0026quot; commits and have all your changes grouped in just one commit. This will keep the maintainer happy!\nGitHub GitHub is the most popular hosting solution for Git repositories. It provides tooling and reliable solutions for version control hosting and is used by millions of developers worldwide.\nIn addition to Git\u0026rsquo;s distributed version control and source code management capabilities, GitHub provides:\n access controll (repositories can be either public or private) bug tracking feature requests task management wiki pages for all projects kanban boards statistics static website hosting etc.  Because projects uploaded to GitHub are not required to meet the Open Source Definition, users are advised to choose the license of every project individually to meet their specific needs.\nFounded in 2007 and continuously improbing GitHub is the most notable place for hosting user\u0026rsquo;s work and enhancing their workflow. It is often considered the Hub of Open Source collaboration and technology learning.\nGeneral GitHub workflow GitHub enhanced Git\u0026rsquo;s collaboration capability with the pull request, providing a GUI way to generate q \u0026lsquo;patch\u0026rsquo;.\nThis set a standard for contributing to saftware projects revolving around the pull request.\nHowever, public collaboration is not the single use case for this workflow. Many private teams employ it to timplify their code review process.\nTo add a feature or an improvement to an existing codebase:\n clone the repository check out the HEADof the development branch - usually masteror develop. make your changes and commit them push the branch to GitHub generate a pull request with the development target branch work with the team to review the pull request (if changes are needed, more commits can be made) when the project owner is ready to accept your proposed changes it can be merged this closes the pull request  Merges Help!
